Assignment 1: Implementation of Factory Design Pattern for a Notification System
Objective
To understand and implement the Factory Design Pattern by creating a notification system that sends messages through Email, SMS, or Push Notification based on user preference or system configuration.
Problem Statement
In real-world applications like banking alerts, OTP systems, and e-commerce platforms, notifications are sent through different channels such as Email, SMS, or Push Notifications.

The system should be designed in such a way that the notification type can be selected dynamically at runtime without modifying the existing code.
Requirements
Create a Notification interface with a method:
Implement the following classes:
EmailNotification
SMSNotification
PushNotification
Each class should provide its own implementation of the sendMessage() method.
Create a NotificationFactory class that contains a method:
Based on the input (Email, SMS, or Push), the factory should return the appropriate notification object.
Write a main class to:
Accept user preference
Use the factory to create the notification object
Send the notification
getNotification(String notificationType)
sendMessage()







Assignment 2: Implementation of Visitor Design Pattern for an Online Shopping Cart
Objective
To understand and implement the Visitor Design Pattern by separating operations from the objects on which they operate.
Problem Statement
In an online shopping system, a cart can contain different types of items such as:
Books
Electronics
Groceries
Different operations need to be performed on these items, such as:
Calculating total price
Applying discounts
Generating bills
Instead of adding these operations inside each item class, the system should use the Visitor Design Pattern to keep the design clean and extensible.
Scenario (Real-World Use Case)
E-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, or Shopify perform multiple operations on products (pricing, discounts, tax calculation, reporting) without frequently modifying product classes.
Requirements
Create an interface ItemElement with a method:
Implement item classes:
Book
Electronics
Grocery
Create a Visitor interface with methods to visit each item type:
Implement a concrete visitor:
PriceCalculatorVisitor
The visitor should calculate the price of each item based on its rules.
Write a main class to:
Add items to the cart
Apply the visitor
Display the total price
visit(Book book)visit(Electronics electronics)visit(Grocery grocery)
accept(Visitor visitor)
